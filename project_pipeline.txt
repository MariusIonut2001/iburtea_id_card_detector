1. We get our image from the webcam
2. Convert it into grayscale and apply edge detector to find edges
3. Find all the contours present in the image -> from this we will filter adn get the biggest contour
4. With the corner points of biggest contour we will use work perspective to get the desired image
5. Apply the adaptive thresholding to get the scanned paper
6. Save image to a folder
